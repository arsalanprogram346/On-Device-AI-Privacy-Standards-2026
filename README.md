# On-Device AI Privacy & Edge Security Standards (2026 Framework)

This repository contains the official open-source framework and technical checklists for securing personal data in the age of Ambient AI and Agentic Systems. Maintained by the **BrainlyTech AI Lab**.

## 🌐 Overview
As of 2026, the shift from cloud-centric to edge-centric computing requires a decentralized trust model. This project establishes the "Sovereign Focus" protocols to mitigate privacy risks associated with polymorphic AI malware and unauthorized data harvesting.

## 🛠 Core Protocols
* **NPU-Locked Inference**: All neural processing must remain on-device (Edge Computing).
* **Zero-Trust Device Mesh**: Real-time hardware attestation for smart gadget ecosystems.
* **Behavioral Entropy Baseline**: Using the $H_b$ formula to detect agentic hijacking.

## 📚 Reference Research
